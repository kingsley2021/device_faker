## Features ✨

- 🎯 **Precise Control**: Configure device information individually for each application
- 📁 **Template Management**: Multiple device templates, easily apply to multiple package names
- 🔄 **Real-time Effect**: After modifying configuration, just restart the application, no need to restart the system
- 🛡️ **Safe and Reliable**: Based on Zygisk framework, modular design
- 📝 **Simple Configuration**: Using TOML format configuration files, easy to edit
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Only takes effect on configured applications, does not affect other applications
- 🎭 **Triple Mode**: lite mode (lightweight stealth) / full mode (complete spoofing) / resetprop mode (supports read-only property modification)
- 🌐 **WebUI Management**: Provides graphical interface for convenient configuration management

## WebUI Features 🖥️

Device Faker provides a modern web management interface.

- 📊 **Status Monitoring**: View module running status in real-time
- 📋 **Template Management**: Create, edit and delete device templates, batch apply to multiple package names
- 📱 **Application Management**: Intuitive view of installed applications and their configuration status
- 🖋️ **Configuration Editing**: Graphical interface for editing application configuration, supporting template application and custom configuration

## Configuration Guide ⚙️

For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the [Configuration Documentation](https://github.com/KernelSU-Modules-Repo/device_faker/blob/main/CONFIG.md).

The configuration file is located at `/data/adb/device_faker/config/config.toml` and uses TOML format. After modifying the configuration, just restart the corresponding application to take effect, no need to restart the system.
